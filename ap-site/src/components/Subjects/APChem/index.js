                <p>AP Chemistry requires lots of practice. Certain aspects of it can seem daunting and difficult at times, but 
                    with continual practice, much of it can begin to make sense. Just make sure to not give up when it seems difficult,
                    but rather stay focused and don't give up!

                <p>Khan Academy has actually very useful resources for this class. There are videos explaining most of the topics. Additionally, 
                    there are practice questions for each topic. The practice questions were actually quite helpful for me throughout
                    the year when practicing for the weekly quizzes and when trying to understand the content.

                <p>There are a bunch of past exams (2014 - Current Day). I would recommend that if studying for a specific topic, 
                    go through the exams looking for questions that line up with the topic you are looking for. If you're looking 
                    for general review, choose any of these exams and go through them question by question. Remember that the mark scheme
                    is there to help you check your answers. <br /> <br />

                    Below is an example of a way you could study. Solve the first question from the 2024 exam, then if you get stuck 
                    or just want to see the problem worked out, check out the video, where you can see the problem solved step 
                    by step.

                <p>This is a great resource to look at, especially as the AP test approaches. You can use to get a rough estimate
                    of what your current AP score would be. Then you can decide what you should focus your time on, whether that is 
                    FRQs, MCQs, or nothing at all!
