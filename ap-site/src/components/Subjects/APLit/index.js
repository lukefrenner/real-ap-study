                <p>AP Literature might come easier to some than others. Those who enjoy reading and can easily understand literature 
                    might find this class not too challenging. For others who might struggle to understand figurative language might 
                    find this class more difficult. However, with practice and perseverance I do believe that everyone can suceed in this class. 
                    It just takes not giving up and continual practice.

            <div class="past_exams_text text_1">
                <p> This class isn't based as much on units that need specific review. Throughout the year you will learn useful
                    information, but to prepare for the AP exam, there isn't much specific review material that I found neccesary 
                    to go through.

            <h2 class="sub_title">AP Lit Exam Prep</h2>
            <div class="past_exams_text lit_text">
                <p>AP Lit has very defined question types that are on the exam that you will need to become extremely familiar with. They are:
                    <ol>
                    <li class="lit_heading">Poetry Analysis Essay</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This was the hardest essay type for me personally. Understanding poetry does not come naturally to me. 
                                If you are in a similar spot, all I can recommend is lots of practice as with time you will become
                                more comfortable in understanding the gist of the poem and be able to pick out details to support your 
                                essay.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="lit_heading">Prose Anaylysis Essay</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prose essays aren't too difficult for most people, including me as understanding prose comes easier to many than poetry. When writing this essay make sure 
                                to not only skim the given passage, but try to really understand it and pick out on unique details. 
                                When doing so writing an essay become simpler and flows well. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li class="lit_heading">Literary Argument Essay</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For me personally, I found that it was helpful to really know 2 - 3 novels/plays well for this essay type. 
                                I was able to pretty much respond to any prompt using the 2 - 3 novels/plays I knew, and by understanding
                                them very well, I was able to go deeper in my essays and inch closer to writing a sophisticated essay. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                    Each of these essay types requires lots of practice in order for you to become comfortable with them. You will 
                    have to write all 3 of these essay back to back, without a break on the exam, which isn't easy. Thus feeling 
                    familiar with the task beforehand will make your job on exam day feel much simpler. I would recommend 
                    sitting down with a timer and writing essays based on released exams in order to improve your skills before
                    the actual exam.

                <p>This is a great resource to look at, especially as the AP test approaches. You can use to get a rough estimate
                    of what your current AP score would be. Then you can decide what you should focus your time on, whether that is 
                    FRQs, MCQs, or nothing at all!
